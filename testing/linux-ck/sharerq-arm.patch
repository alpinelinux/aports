+	  per CPU, whether it is a physical or logical CPU (hyperthread).

+	help
+	  With this option enabled, the CPU scheduler will have one runqueue
+	  shared by multicore siblings in addition to any SMT siblings.
+	  As these physical cores share caches, sharing the runqueue resource
+	  will lead to lower latency, but its effects on overhead and throughput
+	  are less predictable. As a general rule, 6 or fewer cores will likely
+	  benefit from this, while larger CPUs will only derive a latency
+	  benefit. If your workloads are primarily single threaded, this will
+	  possibly worsen throughput. If you are only concerned about latency
+	  then enable this regardless of how many cores you have.
+
+	  This can still be enabled runtime with the boot parameter

+	help
+	  With this option enabled, the CPU scheduler will have one runqueue
+	  shared by all physical CPUs unless they are on separate NUMA nodes.
+	  As physical CPUs usually do not share resources, sharing the runqueue
+	  will normally worsen throughput but improve latency. If you only
+	  care about latency enable this.
