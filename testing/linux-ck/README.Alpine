You may want to copy 60-schedulers.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d.  Con Kolivas wanted BFQ in his patches but it doesn't show on `cat /sys/block/sd*/queue/scheduler` but shows BFQ in dmesg as the default.

You might want to edit it for SSD drives.

We placed this file in share because of package filename collisions for other kernel packages that have interest in forcing BFQ as the default.
