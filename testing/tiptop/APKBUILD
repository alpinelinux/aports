pkgdesc="Tiptop: Hardware Performance Counters for the Masses"
url="http://tiptop.gforge.inria.fr"
# Note: This tool requires two things to work:
# 1: hardware counters in the cpu itself
# 2: support in the kernel perf framework to use them
#
# Right now this applies to x86 only. Note this tool will compile
# elsewhere but without the aforementioned hardware support and kernel
# support, nothing of use will happen when run.

# Note, arg parsing appears to happen after attempting a perf syscall
# so while it would be nice to run tiptop -h to validate the compile worked
# there is a chance it might error out for no reason than the system building
# not having support for the syscall or hardware.
