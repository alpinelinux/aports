Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Fixed darc init for Alpine

Darc has a segmentation fault on Alpine due to not chosing the correct
binary architecture. This patch deletes all the wrong ones so that it
is forced to chose the correct one. This issue only occurs when using 
dotnet-stage0-runtime, thus libunwind is suspected to be the issue as
stage0 wasn't built with system libunwind.
