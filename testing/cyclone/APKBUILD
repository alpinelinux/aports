# Since cyclone itself is written in Scheme it needs to be bootstraped.
# For this propose, upstream provides a dedicated cyclone-bootstrap
# repository which includes C files generated by a previous cyclone
# version. We package cyclone-bootstrap in a separate package and
# compile the original cyclone Scheme sources using it. This is useful
# to backport patches from upstream without having to patch
# compiler-generated C files.
#
# It should also be possible to use provides and a recursive dependency
# for bootstraping in the future. Like we do with rust and others.
