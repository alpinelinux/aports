#   - By default, we can enable the host-deny and the 
#     firewall-drop responses. The first one will add
#     a host to the /etc/hosts.deny and the second one
#     will block the host on iptables (if linux) or on
#     ipfilter (if Solaris, FreeBSD or NetBSD).
#   - They can be used to stop SSHD brute force scans, 
#     portscans and some other forms of attacks. You can 
#     also add them to block on snort events, for example.
