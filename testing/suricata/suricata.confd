# Config file for /etc/init.d/suricata*

# Where config files are stored. Default:

# SURICATA_DIR="/etc/suricata"

# Pass options to each suricata service.
# You can launch more than one service at the same time with different options.
# This can be useful in a multi-queue gateway, for example.
# You can expand on the Suricata inline example found at:
# https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/wiki/Setting_up_IPSinline_for_Linux
# Instead of configuring iptables to send traffic to just one queue, you can configure it to "load balance"
# on several queues. You can then have a Suricata instance processing traffic for each queue.
# This should help improve performance on the gateway/firewall.
# Suppose you configured iptables to use queues 0 and 1. You can now do the following:
# ln -s /etc/init.d/suricata /etc/init.d/suricata.q0
# ln -s /etc/init.d/suricata /etc/init.d/suricata.q1
# cp /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml /etc/suricata/suricata-q0.yaml
# cp /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml /etc/suricata/suricata-q1.yaml
# mkdir /var/log/suricata/q{0,1}
# Edit both suricata-q{0,1}.yaml files and set values accordingly (eg. set the suricata.log file path to
# a dedicated dir in the section "logging:outputs:-file").
# You can then define the following options here:

# SURICATA_OPTS[q0]="-q 0 -l /var/log/suricata/q0"
# SURICATA_OPTS[q1]="-q 1 -l /var/log/suricata/q1"

# If you want to use ${SURICATA_DIR}/suricata.yaml and start the service with /etc/init.d/suricata
# then you can set:

SURICATA_OPTIONS="--af-packet"
