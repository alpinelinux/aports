You need to either:

`apk add bear ycm-generator` to generate a compile_commands.json (to detect compilation flags) and generate a .ycm_extra_conf.py (includes header location) respectively per project and set your 
ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf in order to have the c family completers to work properly

or 

you need to set your ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf to point to /usr/lib/ycmd/.ycm_extra_conf.py to use a more generic but less predictive code completion.

See also /usr/share/ycmd/README.Alpine to enable completer support for the programming language you are working with.
