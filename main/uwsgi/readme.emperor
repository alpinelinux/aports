drop your uwsgi config files inside this directory uwsgi will automatically
load them (Emperor mode) and start a vassal.
uwsgi will run the vassal using the UID/GID of the vassal configuration file.
see: http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Emperor.html
make sure your webserver belongs to the uwsgi group to access the socket.
