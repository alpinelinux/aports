Subject: [PATCH] Correctly handle bogusly large chunk sizes

This fixes a denial of service attack vector where bogusly large chunk
sizes in requests could be used to force restarts of the Varnish
server.

This is Varnish Security Vulnerability VSV00001

For more information visit: https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00001

Fixes: #2379
