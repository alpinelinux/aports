Subject: [PATCH branch-2.4] flow: Fix remote DoS for crafted MPLS packets with
 debug logging enabled.

A crafted MPLS packet yields a zero 'count' in this excerpt from
miniflow_extract():

        count = parse_mpls(&data, &size);
        miniflow_push_words_32(mf, mpls_lse, mpls, count);

In turn, miniflow_push_words_32() updated mf.map as follows:

    MF.map |= ((UINT64_MAX >> (64 - DIV_ROUND_UP(N_WORDS, 2))) << ofs64);

which expanded to:

    mf.map |= (UINT64_MAX >> 64) << ofs64;

Unforunately, C renders shifting a 64-bit constant by 64 bits undefined.
On common x86 platforms, 'n << 64' is equal to 'n', so this behaves as:

    mf.map |= UINT64_MAX << ofs64;

In this particular case, ofs64 is 15, so this sets the most-significant 48
bits of mf.map (a 63-bit bit-field) to 1.  Only the least-significant 28
bits of mf.map should ever be set to 1, so this sets 35 bits to 1 that
should never be.  Because of the structure of the data structure that
mf.map is embedded within, this makes it possible later to overwrite 8*35
== 280 bytes of data in the stack.  However, there is no obvious way to
control the data used in the overwrite--it is memcpy'd from one place to
another but the source data does not come from the network.  In the bug
reporter's testing, this overwrite caused a userspace crash if debug
logging was enabled, but not otherwise.

This commit fixes the problem by avoiding the out-of-range shift.
