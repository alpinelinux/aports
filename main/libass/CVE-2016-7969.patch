Subject: [PATCH] Fix line wrapping mode 0/3 bugs

This fixes two separate bugs:

a) Don't move a linebreak into the first symbol. This results in a empty
   line at the front, which does not help to equalize line lengths at all.
   Instead, merge line with the second one.
b) When moving a linebreak into a symbol that already is a break, the
   number of lines must be decremented. Otherwise, uninitialized memory
   is possibly used for later layout operations.

Found by fuzzer test case
id:000085,sig:11,src:003377+003350,op:splice,rep:8.

This might also affect and hopefully fix libass#229.

v2: change semantics according to review
