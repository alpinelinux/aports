CVE-2016-8606: REPL server vulnerable to HTTP inter-protocol attacks

REPL Server: Guard against HTTP inter-protocol exploitation attacks.
Reported by Christopher Allan Webber <cwebber@dustycloud.org>
Co-authored-by: Ludovic Courtès <ludo@gnu.org>

This commit adds protection to Guile's REPL servers against HTTP
inter-protocol exploitation attacks, a scenario whereby an attacker can,
via an HTML page, cause a web browser to send data to TCP servers
listening on a loopback interface or private network.  See
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-protocol_exploitation> and
<https://www.jochentopf.com/hfpa/hfpa.pdf>, The HTML Form Protocol
Attack (2001) by Tochen Topf <jochen@remote.org>.

Here we add a procedure to 'before-read-hook' that looks for a possible
HTTP request-line in the first line of input from the client socket.  If
present, the socket is drained and closed, and a loud warning is written
to stderr (POSIX file descriptor 2).

* module/system/repl/server.scm: Add 'maybe-check-for-http-request'
to 'before-read-hook' when this module is loaded.
(with-temporary-port-encoding, with-saved-port-line+column)
(drain-input-and-close, permissive-http-request-line?)
(check-for-http-request, guard-against-http-request)
(maybe-check-for-http-request): New procedures.
(serve-client): Use 'guard-against-http-request'.
* module/system/repl/coop-server.scm (start-repl-client): Use
'guard-against-http-request'.
* doc/ref/guile-invoke.texi (Command-line Options): In the description
of the --listen option, make the security warning more prominent.
Mention the new protection added here.  Recommend using UNIX domain
sockets for REPL servers.  "a path to" => "the file name of".
