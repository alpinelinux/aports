Subject: [PATCH] abuild.conf: enable PIE binaries by default for go as well

From `go help environment`:

	GOFLAGS
		A space-separated list of -flag=value settings to apply
		to go commands by default, when the given flag is known by
		the current command. Flags listed on the command-line
		are applied after this list and therefore override it.

And from `go help build`:

	-buildmode mode
		build mode to use. See 'go help buildmode' for more.

Setting this environment variable in /etc/abuild.conf allows us to build
all go binaries on the builders as PIE without needing to patch the go
compiler itself.
