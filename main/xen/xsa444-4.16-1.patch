Subject: x86/svm: Fix asymmetry with AMD DR MASK context switching

The handling of MSR_DR{0..3}_MASK is asymmetric between PV and HVM guests.

HVM guests context switch in based on the guest view of DBEXT, whereas PV
guest switch in base on the host capability.  Both guest types leave the
context dirty for the next vCPU.

This leads to the following issue:

 * PV or HVM guest has debugging active (%dr7 + mask)
 * Switch-out deactivates %dr7 but leaves other state stale in hardware
 * Another HVM guest with masks unavailable has debugging active
 * Switch in loads %dr7 but leaves the mask MSRs alone

Now, the second guest's vCPU is operating in the context of the prior vCPU's
mask MSR, while the environment the vCPU can see says there are no mask MSRs.

As a stopgap, adjust the HVM path to switch in the masks based on host
capabilities rather than guest visibility (i.e. like the PV path).  Adjustment
of the intercepts still needs to be dependent on the guest visibility of
DBEXT.

This is part of XSA-444 / CVE-2023-34327
