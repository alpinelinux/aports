Subject: x86: Don't change the cacheability of the directmap

Changeset 55f97f49b7ce ("x86: Change cache attributes of Xen 1:1 page mappings
in response to guest mapping requests") attempted to keep the cacheability
consistent between different mappings of the same page.

The reason wasn't described in the changelog, but it is understood to be in
regards to a concern over machine check exceptions, owing to errata when using
mixed cacheabilities.  It did this primarily by updating Xen's mapping of the
page in the direct map when the guest mapped a page with reduced cacheability.

Unfortunately, the logic didn't actually prevent mixed cacheability from
occurring:
 * A guest could map a page normally, and then map the same page with
   different cacheability; nothing prevented this.
 * The cacheability of the directmap was always latest-takes-precedence in
   terms of guest requests.
 * Grant-mapped frames with lesser cacheability didn't adjust the page's
   cacheattr settings.
 * The map_domain_page() function still unconditionally created WB mappings,
   irrespective of the page's cacheattr settings.

Additionally, update_xen_mappings() had a bug where the alias calculation was
wrong for mfn's which were .init content, which should have been treated as
fully guest pages, not Xen pages.

Worse yet, the logic introduced a vulnerability whereby necessary
pagetable/segdesc adjustments made by Xen in the validation logic could become
non-coherent between the cache and main memory.  The CPU could subsequently
operate on the stale value in the cache, rather than the safe value in main
memory.

The directmap contains primarily mappings of RAM.  PAT/MTRR conflict
resolution is asymmetric, and generally for MTRR=WB ranges, PAT of lesser
cacheability resolves to being coherent.  The special case is WC mappings,
which are non-coherent against MTRR=WB regions (except for fully-coherent
CPUs).

Xen must not have any WC cacheability in the directmap, to prevent Xen's
actions from creating non-coherency.  (Guest actions creating non-coherency is
dealt with in subsequent patches.)  As all memory types for MTRR=WB ranges
inter-operate coherently, so leave Xen's directmap mappings as WB.

Only PV guests with access to devices can use reduced-cacheability mappings to
begin with, and they're trusted not to mount DoSs against the system anyway.

Drop PGC_cacheattr_{base,mask} entirely, and the logic to manipulate them.
Shift the later PGC_* constants up, to gain 3 extra bits in the main reference
count.  Retain the check in get_page_from_l1e() for special_pages() because a
guest has no business using reduced cacheability on these.

This reverts changeset 55f97f49b7ce6c3520c555d19caac6cf3f9a5df0

This is CVE-2022-26363, part of XSA-402.
