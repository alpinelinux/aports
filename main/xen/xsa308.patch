Subject: x86/vtx: Work around SingleStep + STI/MovSS VMEntry failures

See patch comment for technical details.

Concerning the timeline, this was first discovered in the aftermath of
XSA-156 which caused #DB to be intercepted unconditionally, but only in
its SingleStep + STI form which is restricted to privileged software.

After working with Intel and identifying the problematic vmentry check,
this workaround was suggested, and the patch was posted in an RFC
series.  Outstanding work for that series (not breaking Introspection)
is still pending, and this fix from it (which wouldn't have been good
enough in its original form) wasn't committed.

A vmentry failure was reported to xen-devel, and debugging identified
this bug in its SingleStep + MovSS form by way of INT1, which does not
involve the use of any privileged instructions, and proving this to be a
security issue.

This is XSA-308
