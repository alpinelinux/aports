Subject: x86/pv: Correct the auditing of guest breakpoint addresses

The use of access_ok() is buggy, because it permits access to the compat
translation area.  64bit PV guests don't use the XLAT area, but on AMD
hardware, the DBEXT feature allows a breakpoint to match up to a 4G aligned
region, allowing the breakpoint to reach outside of the XLAT area.

Prior to c/s cda16c1bb223 ("x86: mirror compat argument translation area for
32-bit PV"), the live GDT was within 4G of the XLAT area.

All together, this allowed a malicious 64bit PV guest on AMD hardware to place
a breakpoint over the live GDT, and trigger a #DB livelock (CVE-2015-8104).

Introduce breakpoint_addr_ok() and explain why __addr_ok() happens to be an
appropriate check in this case.

For Xen 4.14 and later, this is a latent bug because the XLAT area has moved
to be on its own with nothing interesting adjacent.  For Xen 4.13 and older on
AMD hardware, this fixes a PV-trigger-able DoS.

This is part of XSA-444 / CVE-2023-34328.

+ * Breakpoint lengths are specified to mask the low order address bits,

+ * (to Xen) if the guest breakpoints it's alias of the M2P.  Skipping this

+ * which operated fine on prior versions of Xen.
