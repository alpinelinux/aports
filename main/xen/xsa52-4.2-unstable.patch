x86/xsave: fix information leak on AMD CPUs

Just like for FXSAVE/FXRSTOR, XSAVE/XRSTOR also don't save/restore the
last instruction and operand pointers as well as the last opcode if
there's no pending unmasked exception (see CVE-2006-1056 and commit
9747:4d667a139318).

While the FXSR solution sits in the save path, I prefer to have this in
the restore path because there the handling is simpler (namely in the
context of the pending changes to properly save the selector values for
32-bit guest code).

Also this is using FFREE instead of EMMS, as it doesn't seem unlikely
that in the future we may see CPUs with x87 and SSE/AVX but no MMX
support. The goal here anyway is just to avoid an FPU stack overflow.
I would have preferred to use FFREEP instead of FFREE (freeing two
stack slots at once), but AMD doesn't document that instruction.

This is CVE-2013-2076 / XSA-52.
