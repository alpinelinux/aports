Subject: x86/emul: Fix extable registration in invoke_stub()

For exception recovery in the stubs, the registered address for fixup is the
return address of the CALL entering the stub.

In invoke_stub(), the '.Lret%=:' label is the wrong side of the 'post'
parameter.  The 'post' parameter is non-empty in cases where the arithmetic
flags of the operation need recovering.

Split the line to separate 'pre' and 'post', making it more obvious that the
return address label was in the wrong position.

However, in the case that an exception did occur, we want to skip 'post' as
it's logically part of the operation which had already failed.  Therefore, add
a new skip label and use that for the exception recovery path.

This is XSA-470 / CVE-2025-27465
