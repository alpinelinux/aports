Subject: [PATCH 3/3] x86/mm: Prevent some races in hypervisor mapping updates

map_pages_to_xen will attempt to coalesce mappings into 2MiB and 1GiB
superpages if possible, to maximize TLB efficiency.  This means both
replacing superpage entries with smaller entries, and replacing
smaller entries with superpages.

Unfortunately, while some potential races are handled correctly,
others are not.  These include:

1. When one processor modifies a sub-superpage mapping while another
processor replaces the entire range with a superpage.

Take the following example:

Suppose L3[N] points to L2.  And suppose we have two processors, A and
B.

* A walks the pagetables, get a pointer to L2.
* B replaces L3[N] with a 1GiB mapping.
* B Frees L2
* A writes L2[M] #

This is race exacerbated by the fact that virt_to_xen_l[21]e doesn't
handle higher-level superpages properly: If you call virt_xen_to_l2e
on a virtual address within an L3 superpage, you'll either hit a BUG()
(most likely), or get a pointer into the middle of a data page; same
with virt_xen_to_l1 on a virtual address within either an L3 or L2
superpage.

So take the following example:

* A reads pl3e and discovers it to point to an L2.
* B replaces L3[N] with a 1GiB mapping
* A calls virt_to_xen_l2e() and hits the BUG_ON() #

2. When two processors simultaneously try to replace a sub-superpage
mapping with a superpage mapping.

Take the following example:

Suppose L3[N] points to L2.  And suppose we have two processors, A and B,
both trying to replace L3[N] with a superpage.

* A walks the pagetables, get a pointer to pl3e, and takes a copy ol3e pointing to L2.
* B walks the pagetables, gets a pointre to pl3e, and takes a copy ol3e pointing to L2.
* A writes the new value into L3[N]
* B writes the new value into L3[N]
* A recursively frees all the L1's under L2, then frees L2
* B recursively double-frees all the L1's under L2, then double-frees L2 #

Fix this by grabbing a lock for the entirety of the mapping update
operation.

Rather than grabbing map_pgdir_lock for the entire operation, however,
repurpose the PGT_locked bit from L3's page->type_info as a lock.
This means that rather than locking the entire address space, we
"only" lock a single 512GiB chunk of hypervisor address space at a
time.

There was a proposal for a lock-and-reverify approach, where we walk
the pagetables to the point where we decide what to do; then grab the
map_pgdir_lock, re-verify the information we collected without the
lock, and finally make the change (starting over again if anything had
changed).  Without being able to guarantee that the L2 table wasn't
freed, however, that means every read would need to be considered
potentially unsafe.  Thinking carefully about that is probably
something that wants to be done on public, not under time pressure.

This is part of XSA-345.
