Subject: [PATCH] x86/amd: fix legacy setting of SSBD on AMD Family 17h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current logic to set SSBD on AMD Family 17h and Hygon Family 18h
processors requires that the setting of SSBD is coordinated at a core
level, as the setting is shared between threads.  Logic was introduced
to keep track of how many threads require SSBD active in order to
coordinate it, such logic relies on using a per-core counter of
threads that have SSBD active.

Given the current logic, it's possible for a guest to under or
overflow the thread counter, because each write to VIRT_SPEC_CTRL.SSBD
by the guest gets propagated to the helper that does the per-core
active accounting.  Overflowing the counter is not so much of an
issue, as this would just make SSBD sticky.

Underflowing however is more problematic: on non-debug Xen builds a
guest can perform empty writes to VIRT_SPEC_CTRL that would cause the
counter to underflow and thus the value gets saturated to the max
value of unsigned int.  At which points attempts from any thread to
set VIRT_SPEC_CTRL.SSBD won't get propagated to the hardware anymore,
because the logic will see that the counter is greater than 1 and
assume that SSBD is already active, effectively loosing the setting
of SSBD and the protection it provides.

Fix this by introducing a per-CPU variable that keeps track of whether
the current thread has legacy SSBD active or not, and thus only
attempt to propagate the value to the hardware once the thread
selected value changes.

This is XSA-431 / CVE-2022-42336
