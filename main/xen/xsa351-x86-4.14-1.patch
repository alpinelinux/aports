Subject: x86/msr: fix handling of MSR_IA32_PERF_{STATUS/CTL}
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently a PV hardware domain can also be given control over the CPU
frequency, and such guest is allowed to write to MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL.
However since commit 322ec7c89f6 the default behavior has been changed
to reject accesses to not explicitly handled MSRs, preventing PV
guests that manage CPU frequency from reading
MSR_IA32_PERF_{STATUS/CTL}.

Additionally some HVM guests (Windows at least) will attempt to read
MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL and will panic if given back a #GP fault:

  vmx.c:3035:d8v0 RDMSR 0x00000199 unimplemented
  d8v0 VIRIDIAN CRASH: 3b c0000096 fffff806871c1651 ffffda0253683720 0

Move the handling of MSR_IA32_PERF_{STATUS/CTL} to the common MSR
handling shared between HVM and PV guests, and add an explicit case
for reads to MSR_IA32_PERF_{STATUS/CTL}.

Restore previous behavior and allow PV guests with the required
permissions to read the contents of the mentioned MSRs. Non privileged
guests will get 0 when trying to read those registers, as writes to
MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL by such guest will already be silently dropped.

Fixes: 322ec7c89f6 ('x86/pv: disallow access to unknown MSRs')
Fixes: 84e848fd7a1 ('x86/hvm: disallow access to unknown MSRs')
