Subject: x86/shadow: Avoid overflowing sh_ctxt->seg_reg[]

hvm_get_seg_reg() does not perform a range check on its input segment, calls
hvm_get_segment_register() and writes straight into sh_ctxt->seg_reg[].

x86_seg_none is outside the bounds of sh_ctxt->seg_reg[], and will hit a BUG()
in {vmx,svm}_get_segment_register().

HVM guests running with shadow paging can end up performing a virtual to
linear translation with x86_seg_none.  This is used for addresses which are
already linear.  However, none of this is a legitimate pagetable update, so
fail the emulation in such a case.

This is XSA-187
