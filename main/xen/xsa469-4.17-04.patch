Subject: x86/thunk: (Mis)align the RETs in clear_bhb_loops() to mitigate ITS

The Indirect Target Selection speculative vulnerability means that indirect
branches (including RETs) are unsafe when in the first half of a cacheline.

clear_bhb_loops() has a precise layout of branches.  The alignment for
performance cause the RETs to always be in an unsafe position, and converting
those to return thunks changes the branching pattern.  While such a conversion
is believed to be safe, clear_bhb_loops() is also a performance-relevant
fastpath, so (mis)align the RETs to be in a safe position.

No functional change.

This is part of XSA-469 / CVE-2024-28956
