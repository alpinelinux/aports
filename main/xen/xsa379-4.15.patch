Subject: x86/mm: widen locked region in xenmem_add_to_physmap_one()

For pages which can be made part of the P2M by the guest, but which can
also later be de-allocated (grant table v2 status pages being the
present example), it is imperative that they be mapped at no more than a
single GFN. We therefore need to make sure that of two parallel
XENMAPSPACE_grant_table requests for the same status page one completes
before the second checks at which other GFN the underlying MFN is
presently mapped.

Push down the respective put_gfn(). This leverages that gfn_lock()
really aliases p2m_lock(), but the function makes this assumption
already anyway: In the XENMAPSPACE_gmfn case lock nesting constraints
for both involved GFNs would otherwise need to be enforced to avoid ABBA
deadlocks.

This is CVE-2021-28697 / XSA-379.

Since there was some re-ordering of the checks in staging/master (the
-EXDEV now sitting earlier there), I deemed it better to drop the
earlier "if ( rc )" and allow an earlier error to be overwritten by
-EXDEV here.
