Subject: [PATCH] iommu/amd-vi: use correct level for quarantine domain page
 tables
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current setup of the quarantine page tables assumes that the quarantine
domain (dom_io) has been initialized with an address width of
DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ADDRESS_WIDTH (48).

However dom_io being a PV domain gets the AMD-Vi IOMMU page tables levels based
on the maximum (hot pluggable) RAM address, and hence on systems with no RAM
above the 512GB mark only 3 page-table levels are configured in the IOMMU.

On systems without RAM above the 512GB boundary amd_iommu_quarantine_init()
will setup page tables for the scratch page with 4 levels, while the IOMMU will
be configured to use 3 levels only.  The page destined to be used as level 1,
and to contain a directory of PTEs ends up being the address in a PTE itself,
and thus level 1 page becomes the leaf page.  Without the level mismatch it's
level 0 page that should be the leaf page instead.

The level 1 page won't be used as such, and hence it's not possible to use it
to gain access to other memory on the system.  However that page is not cleared
in amd_iommu_quarantine_init() as part of re-initialization of the device
quarantine page tables, and hence data on the level 1 page can be leaked
between device usages.

Fix this by making sure the paging levels setup by amd_iommu_quarantine_init()
match the number configured on the IOMMUs.

Note that IVMD regions are not affected by this issue, as those areas are
mapped taking the configured paging levels into account.

This is XSA-445 / CVE-2023-46835
