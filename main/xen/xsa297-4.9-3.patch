Subject: x86/msr: Definitions for MSR_INTEL_CORE_THREAD_COUNT

This is a model specific register which details the current configuration
cores and threads in the package.  Because of how Hyperthread and Core
configuration works works in firmware, the MSR it is de-facto constant and
will remain unchanged until the next system reset.

It is a read only MSR (so unilaterally reject writes), but for now retain its
leaky-on-read properties.  Further CPUID/MSR work is required before we can
start virtualising a consistent topology to the guest, and retaining the old
behaviour is the safest course of action.
