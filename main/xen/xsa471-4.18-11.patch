Subject: x86/idle: Implement a new MWAIT IPI-elision algorithm
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In order elide IPIs, we must be able to identify whether a target CPU is in
MWAIT at the point it is woken up.  i.e. the store to wake it up must also
identify the state.

Create a new in_mwait variable beside __softirq_pending, so we can use a
CMPXCHG to set the softirq while also observing the status safely.  Implement
an x86 version of arch_pend_softirq() which does this.

In mwait_idle_with_hints(), advertise in_mwait, with an explanation of
precisely what it means.  X86_BUG_MONITOR can be accounted for simply by not
advertising in_mwait.
