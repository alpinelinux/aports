Subject: x86/idle: Drop incorrect smp_mb() in mwait_idle_with_hints()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With the recent simplifications, it becomes obvious that smp_mb() isn't the
right barrier.  Strictly speaking, MONITOR is ordered as a load, but smp_rmb()
isn't correct either, as this only pertains to local ordering.  All we need is
a compiler barrier().

Merge the barier() into the monitor() itself, along with an explantion.

No functional change.
