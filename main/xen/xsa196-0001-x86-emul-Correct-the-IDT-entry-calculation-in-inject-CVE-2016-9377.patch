Subject: x86/emul: Correct the IDT entry calculation in inject_swint()

The logic, as introduced in c/s 36ebf14ebe "x86/emulate: support for emulating
software event injection" is buggy.  The size of an IDT entry depends on long
mode being active, not the width of the code segment currently in use.

In particular, this means that a compatibility code segment which hits
emulation for software event injection will end up using an incorrect offset
in the IDT for DPL/Presence checking.  In practice, this only occurs on old
AMD hardware lacking NRip support; all newer AMD hardware, and all Intel
hardware bypass this path in the emulator.

While here, fix a minor issue with reading the IDT entry.  The return value
from ops->read() wasn't checked, but in reality the only failure case is if a
pagefault occurs.  This is not a realistic problem as the kernel will almost
certainly crash with a double fault if this setup actually occured.

This is part of XSA-196.
