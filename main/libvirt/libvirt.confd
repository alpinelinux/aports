#LIBVIRTD_OPTS="--listen"

# Valid options:
# * shutdown - Sends an ACPI shutdown (think when you tap the power button
# 				on your machine and it begins a graceful shutdown). If your
# 				VM ignores this, it will have the power yanked out from under
# 				it in LIBVIRTD_KVM_SHUTDOWN_MAXWAIT seconds.
# * managedsave - Performs a state save external to the VM. qemu-kvm will stop
# 				stop the CPU and save off all state to a separate file. When
# 				the machine is started again, it will resume like nothing ever
# 				happened. This is guarenteed to always successfully stop your
# 				machine and restart it. However it may take some time to finish.
# * none - No attempts will be made to stop any VMs. If you are restarting your
# 		machine the qemu-kvm process will be simply killed, which may result
# 		in your VMs having disk corruption.
