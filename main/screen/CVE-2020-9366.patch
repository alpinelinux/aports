Subject: Fix out of bounds access when setting w_xtermosc after OSC 49
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

echo -e "\e]49\e;                                    \n\ec"
crashes screen.

This happens because 49 is divided by 10 and used as table index
resulting in access to w_xtermosc[4], which is out of bounds with table
itself being size 4. Increase size of table by 1 to 5, which is enough
for all current uses.

As this overwrites memory based on user input it is potential security
issue.
