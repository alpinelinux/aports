+# mkinitfs
+
+This is the initramfs generator for Alpine Linux, including support for apk and 
+Alpine Diskless boot.
+
+## Dependencies
+
+To compile manually, you need to have the following build tools available:
+
+- make
+- gcc with musl and kernel-headers
+
+nlplug-findfs will link against the following libraries (runtime deps):
+
+- libkmod
+- libblkid (from util-linux)
+- libcryptsetup
+
+## Installation
+
+Build mkinitfs via `make` and install it via `make install`.
+The installation honours the `DESTDIR` parameter to overwrite the sysroot path.
+
+For testing, its not necessary to install `mkinitfs` into your root file system.
+
+## Tweaking
+
+The Makefile is kept slim and debuggable.
