Subject: Fix integer overflow resulting in insufficient heap allocation

IMAGE_DIMENSIONS_OK ensures that image width and height are less then
46340, so that maximum number of pixels is ~2**31.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of code that allocates image data with
something like

   malloc(w * h * sizeof(DATA32));

Obviously, on 32-bit machines this results in integer overflow,
insufficient heap allocation, with [massive] out-of-bounds heap
overwrite.
Either X_MAX should be reduced to 32767, or (w)*(h) should be checked to
not exceed ULONG_MAX/sizeof(DATA32).

Security implications:
*) for 32-bit machines: insufficient heap allocation and heap overwrite
in many image loaders, with escalation potential to remote code
execution;
*) for 64-bit machines: it seems, no impact.
