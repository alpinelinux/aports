Subject: [PATCH] res_pjsip_sdp_rtp:  Fix return code from apply_negotiated_sdp_stream

apply_negotiated_sdp_stream was returning a "1" when no joint
capabilities were found on an outgoing call instead of a "-1".
This indicated to res_pjsip_session that the handler DID handle
the sdp when in fact it didn't.  Without the appropriate setup,
a subsequent media frame coming in would have an invalid stream_num
and cause a seg fault when the stream was attempted to be retrieved.

apply_negotiated_sdp_stream now returns the correct "-1" and any
media is now discarded before it reaches the core stream processing.
