Subject: [PATCH] fix build failure due to typo in the build script

The fixed commit had a typo where it would try to call a nonexistant
function instead of the .contains method of the relevant array.
This was only made visible when the "other" loaders were enabled so it
is triggered all the time.

This was made visible when working on
https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/gdk-pixbuf2/-/merge_requests/1

Fixes: 81a77399a ("Update the testsuite")
