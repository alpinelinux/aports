-  # phrase emphasis, and spans. The list of tags we're looking for is
-  # hard-coded.
-  #

-  # _HashHTMLBlocks_InHTML when it encounter block tags. When the markdown="1" 
-  # attribute is found whitin a tag, _HashHTMLBlocks_InHTML calls back
-  #  _HashHTMLBlocks_InMarkdown to handle the Markdown syntax within the tag.

-PHP Markdown Extra
-==================
-
-Description
------------
-
-This is a PHP port of the original Markdown formatter written in Perl 
-by John Gruber. This special "Extra" version of PHP Markdown features 
-further enhancements to the syntax for making additional constructs 
-such as tables and definition list.
-
-Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
-easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
-is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
-as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.
-
-Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
-specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use span-level
-HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
-HTML tags (like <div> and <table> as well).
-
-For more information about Markdown's syntax, see:
-
-<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>
-
-
-Bugs
-----
-
-To file bug reports please send email to:
-
-<michel.fortin@michelf.com>
-
-Please include with your report: (1) the example input; (2) the output you
-expected; (3) the output Markdown actually produced.

+     *
+     * `pad_before` bytes will be skipped before writing the compressed

-/*!\file decoder_impl.h
- * \brief Describes the decoder algorithm interface for algorithm
- *        implementations.
- *
- * This file defines the private structures and data types that are only
- * relevant to implementing an algorithm, as opposed to using it.
- *
- * To create a decoder algorithm class, an interface structure is put
- * into the global namespace:
- *     <pre>
- *     my_codec.c:
- *       vpx_codec_iface_t my_codec = {
- *           "My Codec v1.0",
- *           VPX_CODEC_ALG_ABI_VERSION,
- *           ...
- *       };
- *     </pre>
- *
- * An application instantiates a specific decoder instance by using
- * vpx_codec_init() and a pointer to the algorithm's interface structure:
- *     <pre>
- *     my_app.c:
- *       extern vpx_codec_iface_t my_codec;
- *       {
- *           vpx_codec_ctx_t algo;
- *           res = vpx_codec_init(&algo, &my_codec);
- *       }
- *     </pre>
- *
- * Once initialized, the instance is manged using other functions from
- * the vpx_codec_* family.
