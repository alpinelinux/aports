    evdns: fix searching empty hostnames
    
    From #332:
      Here follows a bug report by **Guido Vranken** via the _Tor bug bounty program_. Please credit Guido accordingly.
    
      ## Bug report
    
      The DNS code of Libevent contains this rather obvious OOB read:
    
      ```c
      static char *
      search_make_new(const struct search_state *const state, int n, const char *const base_name) {
          const size_t base_len = strlen(base_name);
          const char need_to_append_dot = base_name[base_len - 1] == '.' ? 0 : 1;
      ```
    
      If the length of ```base_name``` is 0, then line 3125 reads 1 byte before the buffer. This will trigger a crash on ASAN-protected builds.
    
      To reproduce:
    
      Build libevent with ASAN:
      ```
      $ CFLAGS='-fomit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address' ./configure && make -j4
      ```
      Put the attached ```resolv.conf``` and ```poc.c``` in the source directory and then do:
    
      ```
      $ gcc -fsanitize=address -fomit-frame-pointer poc.c .libs/libevent.a
      $ ./a.out
      =================================================================
      ==22201== ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x60060000efdf at pc 0x4429da bp 0x7ffe1ed47300 sp 0x7ffe1ed472f8
      READ of size 1 at 0x60060000efdf thread T0
      ```
    
    P.S. we can add a check earlier, but since this is very uncommon, I didn't add it.
    
    Fixes: #332
