Subject: [PATCH] build: fix netinet/sctp.h not to be installed

After libcnetinet_HEADERS was set to sctp.h.in, netinet/sctp.h can
no longer be installed into ${includedir}.

Since "AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([src/include/netinet/sctp.h])" is already
added into configure.ac, there's no need to generate sctp.h by
automake.

So we simply set libcnetinet_HEADERS back to sctp.h.

Fixes: 9607dd85e70a ("netinet/sctp.h: dynamically build based on system setup")
