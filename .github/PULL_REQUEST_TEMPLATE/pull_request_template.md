For this PR, I have:
<!-- aports checklist -->
<!-- You can remove any items that don't apply. This is a helpful starting point. -->
- [ ] Prefixed repo/name: directory in my commit title line
- [ ] Started `pkgrel` at `0` for a new version or increased `pkgrel`
- [ ] Used "upgraded to" or "new aport" phrase in title line
- [ ] Used global `depends_`_split_ variables (e.g. `depends_dev` or `$pkgname-foo:_foo` => `depends__foo`)
<!-- Before adding anything else, please consider if it applies to all future PRs. -->
