* yt-dlp-ejs-rt-quickjs makes sure that quickjs is installed, but it's not enabled by default.
* You must add `--js-runtimes=quickjs` to your command line options or config
* ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yt-dlp/config or /etc/yt-dlp/config) to allow the use,
*
* Also, deno and nodejs will be preferred by default if installed. If that's not desired,
* you must add `--no-js-runtimes` before it.
