Subject: [PATCH] [rofi-sensible-terminal] Use /bin/sh instead of /usr/bin/env bash
Patch-Source: https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/pull/1478

This script is fully POSIX-sh compatible, i.e. it's portable and can be
run in any shell, not just bash. It's incorrect to assume that bash is
available on every *nix system (it's not), but /bin/sh is.
