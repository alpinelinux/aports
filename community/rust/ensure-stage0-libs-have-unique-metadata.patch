Subject: [PATCH] Ensure libraries built in stage0 have unique metadata

Issue #50786 shows a case with local rebuild where the libraries built
by stage0 had the same suffix as stage0's own, and were accidentally
loaded by that stage0 rustc when compiling `librustc_trans`.

Now we set `__CARGO_DEFAULT_LIB_METADATA` to "bootstrap" during stage0,
rather than the release channel like usual, so the library suffix will
always be completely distinct from the stage0 compiler.
