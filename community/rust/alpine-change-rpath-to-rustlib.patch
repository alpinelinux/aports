Subject: [PATCH] Change rpath for rustc/rustdoc to rustlib/$TARGET/lib

Rust installs two identical sets of *.so libraries into /usr/lib and
/usr/lib/rustlib/$TARGET/lib. The former comes with the rustc component,
/usr/bin/rustc and /usr/bin/rustdoc are linked against them. The latter
comes with rust-std and are used for binaries dynamically linked against
Rust libraries (usually compiler plugins, like clippy).

These *.so libraries don't keep stable ABI, so it's better to treat
them as private. Such libraries should not be exposed at standard paths
like /usr/lib, but use rpath.

This patch changes rpath for binaries of the rustc component to
`$ORIGIN/../lib/rustlib/$TARGET/lib`. Duplicate libraries will be still
installed into /usr/lib, but we can simply remove them when packaging.
