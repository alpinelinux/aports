#  Almost all of the QuickPage configuration options    #
#  can be controlled at run-time by keywords in the     #
#  configuration file.  However, there is a small       #
#  set of options that must be defined at compile       #
#  time.                                                #
#                                                       #
#  Here are the compile-time configuration options.     #
#  Edit these as appropriate for your environment.      #
#                                                       #
#  Note: This file is sourced by the configure script.  #
#  Do not make any changes incompatible with /bin/sh.   #

#
# QPAGE_CONFIG defines the location of the configuration file.
# See the QuickPage documentation for complete details about
# the syntax of the configuration file.
#
QPAGE_CONFIG="/etc/qpage/qpage.cf"


#
# SNPP_SERVER defines the default name of the SNPP server.
# The default is localhost.  This is probably not appropriate
# for most network configurations; change this to the machine
# where you intend to run the QuickPage daemon.  Multiple
# hostnames can be specified by separating them with commas.
#
SNPP_SERVER="localhost"


#
# SNPP_SERVER_FILE defines a filename containing one or
# more hostnames of SNPP servers.  QuickPage clients
# read this file (if it exists) to locate a server.  All
# servers listed in this file are assumed to have identical
# copies of the configuration file.  Only one filename
# may be specified.
#
SNPP_SERVER_FILE="/etc/qpage/qpage.servers"


#
# DAEMON_USER specifies which user the QuickPage daemon
# should run as after dropping root privileges.  If a
# userid or UID is specified and a password entry exists
# for that user, QuickPage will assume all group privileges
# assigned to that user.
#
DAEMON_USER="qpage"


#
# SYSLOG_FACILITY defines which syslog facility should be
# used by QuickPage to log messages.  See the syslog
# documentation (i.e. "man syslog") for more information.
#
SYSLOG_FACILITY=LOG_DAEMON


#
# SENDMAIL_PATH defines where sendmail (or equivalent) is
# located on your system.  QuickPage uses sendmail to send
# status messages about failed and/or high-priority pages.
# Whatever you specify here will be invoked with exactly
# three arguments:
#
#    arg1: "-f"
#    arg2: "<>"
#    arg3: user@host
#
# The first two arguments tell sendmail to use a null return
# path (see RFC1123 section 5.2.9) so that bogus e-mail
# addresses will not annoy the postmaster.
#
# If you leave this variable commented out, "configure" will
# attempt to locate the correct path for your system automatically.
#
#SENDMAIL_PATH=/usr/lib/sendmail
