# For the different logbookd modes:
# -r for reduced write mode, it uses an in-memory database and only writes the database on exit or USR1
# -d is the path for the database, it defaults to in-memory when not specified
# -g kB is the amount of uncommitted data in the in-memory database that will trigger a disk write
#    this defaults to -1 to never automatically write the files
